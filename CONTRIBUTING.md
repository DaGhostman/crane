# How to Contribute

As an open source project, we rely on community members contributing code to stay alive.

Please feel free to find an open bug and do some work on it, then send us a pull request.

## Bug Reports

Please submit as much detail as possible when creating a bug report. Saying "it doesn't work" with no other detail is not helpful to us; you should include:

- Project size (number of files and size on disk)
- Overview of computer specs
- Your operating system
- Some basic steps to reproduce the issue (if possible)

## Making Changes

When making changes, please adhere to the coding standards detailed below.

When you're ready to merge your changes back into the main project, please submit a pull request to the **develop** branch, not master. This allows me to easily test new features/bug fixes contributed by the community.

## Coding Standards

 - **Indentation** -> 4 spaces in all files
 - **Typescript** -> please use type hinting where ever possible
 - **Curly Brackets** -> should be on the same line as the declaration (eg `array.forEach(item) => {`)
 - **Quotes** -> Use double quotes (`"`) instead of single quotes(`'`) or backticks (`)
