## Crane - PHP Intellisense/code-completion for VS Code

Please go to https://github.com/HvyIndustries/crane for source code, bug tracking and feature requests.

Follow [@HvyIndustries](https://twitter.com/HvyIndustries) on Twitter for updates!

## Functionality

This extension provides semi-intelligent Intellisense and code-completion suggestions for VS Code.

For the best development experience, make sure you have the PHP linter enabled in your user settings, and set it to run `onType` instead of `onSave`!
