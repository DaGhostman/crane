## Crane - PHP Intellisense/code-completion for VS Code

Please go to https://github.com/HvyIndustries/crane for source code, bug tracking and feature requests.

Follow [@HvyIndustries](https://twitter.com/HvyIndustries) on Twitter for updates!

## Functionality

This extension provides semi-intelligent Intellisense and code-completion suggestions for VS Code.

For the best development experience, make sure you have the PHP linter enabled in your user settings, and set it to run `onType` instead of `onSave`!

## User Feedback

> **Another total must have for PHP developers using Visual Studio Code.**

## Customization

### Downloading PHP Libraries

To download additional php libraries, press `F1` and search for `Crane - Download PHP Libraries`
Once the libraries have been downloaded, you will need to rebuild the sources if sources have already been built.

### Rebuilding Sources

To rebuild sources, press `F1` and search for `Crane - Rebuild Sources`. This will instruct
Crane to rebuild the file sources. This can be useful if your sources somehow get out of sync.
This is also useful if new typings are added.

## Upcoming features

* **Go to definition** (pressing F12)
* **Find references**
* Signature provider to show method parameter suggestions
* Hover provider to show information about symbol under the cursor
* Peek definition
* List symbols
* PhpDoc support (both for reading and writing documentation)

## Known Issues

* The extension has some issues with showing suggestions for very large projects
* There are currently no suggestions for built-in classes such as `PDO` (support for this is coming soon)
* There can be strange behaviour when working with PHP and HTML in the same file
